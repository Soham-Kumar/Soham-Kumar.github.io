                    <p>
                        Rockstar as a movie hits different people differently, but almost everyone feels a certain mystic element to it.
                        This is closely related to Jung's concept of the <i>collective unconscious</i> - the idea that all humans,
                        across cultures and geographies share a common set of memories and ideas. Hence althoug a person may not be
                        able to articulate why he appreciates the movie, he still does. Reading interpretations of such movies is an
                        aha moment. Janardhan/Jordan's personality also fits in the archetype of a <i>tortured poet</i>.

                    <h3>Man is condemned to be free</h3>
                    <p>
                        <blockquote>
                            "Man is condemned to be free. Condemned, because he did not create himself; in other respect is free because, once thrown into the world, he is responsible for everything he does." 
                            <footer>~  Jean-Paul Sartre, Existentialism and Human Emotions</footer>
                        </blockquote>
        
                        <i>"Condemned to be free"</i> may sound paradoxical, but it encapsulates the human condition: compelled to act yet burdened with justifying those actions.
                        Humanity stands between animals and gods—neither bound by pure instinct nor entirely free of it. This freedom demands reflection and this is what defines the
                        human life - the need to find a <i>raison d'être</i> to navigate the sufferings of daily existence.<sup><a href="#ref3">3</a></sup></br></br>
        
                        The biology, the nature doesn't owe you a beautiful existence, it doesn't owe you a life that you will like - its optimized to perpetuate itself, and not for the
                        satisfaction of the individuals that constitute it. But it does realize that a one needs some trinkets to be pleasured with to keep the machinery running. You are lucky
                        if these trinkets take you far in life, but there must come a time sooner or later that these trinkets start looking as what they truly are - childish playthings. Upon
                        hitting this realization, good and bad both times start having an undercurrent of deep, unwavering and surreal feeling of meaninglessness. The second consequence (or the
                        second order effect) of this realization is the loss of <i>home</i>. Frued talks about the loss of a loved object through disappointment and how it leads to losing a part
                        of yourself and its relation to melancholy.<sup><a href="#ref4">4</a></sup> This loss of meaning is imminent to come to everyone, but to some death comes first. Who is luckier:
                        one who lives merrily, deceived by fleeting illusions, or the one burdened by the weight of their falsity?</br></br>
        
                        But why doesn't life have an inherent meaning? Because asking for the meaning of life is asking for a linear answer to a circular question.</br>

                            <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Person A:</span> That doesn't explain why your parents exist. I could just keep asking why to all of your responses all the way back to the Big Bang,
                                at which point you'll essentially be saying because existence began to which I will ask why did existence begin, and we will have arrived back at square one. So, I'll ask again why,
                                why are you?"</p>
                            <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Person B:</span> Uhmmm I exist to bring my future children into this world.</p>

                                and you'll run out of answers. That's exactly the issue though. That's why I'm saying - there's no meaning to any of it. It's all for nothing. Looking backwards it's accidents all the way back and
                                there's no meaning to any of it looking forwards, it all comes to an end. So that settles it then - that's your answer - that it's all for nothing. Both the ends of the thread
                                of time are loose and all you have to do is pull, and the whole damn thing unravels back to the present moment. There's no real point in getting out of bed in the morning,
                                no point in having kids, my parents gave birth to me for no reason at all, and it's all for nothing.</br></br>
                                What's it <i>ALL</i> for? It can't all be for something else because then you wouldn't have been talking about IT ALL, would you? Your question cannot be answered without referring to
                                something within your expression IT ALL. For even if I did give you an answer that referred to something outside of IT ALL, like heaven for instance, as soon as its existence was an
                                established fact it would be contained within the expression IT ALL.</p>

                        I’m particularly impressed by the seamless integration of visual and sequence-based learning. 
                        However, there are challenges, such as scaling to diverse environments and ensuring generalization across tasks.

                            What is it that constitutes the history of each day for you? Look at your habits of which it consists: are they the product of numberless little acts of cowardice
                            and laziness, or of your bravery and inventive reason?” </br> ~ Friedrich Nietzsche,
