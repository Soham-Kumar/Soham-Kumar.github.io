            <p>
                At some junctures in life you are given with choices that are far from trivial. These choices determine, to a large extent, the path your life takes.
                <!-- These choices decide what you recall as a flashback when you are on your deathbed. -->
                These choices must emanate from a deep understanding of the nature
                of the world, the role of oneself in it and the life one wants to lead. More often than not, the time to make these choices comes much earlier than the
                stage where you understand the world and yourself good enough for them. Still one must make these choices, and lay down the prospectives of greatness at
                helm of rather weak threads. To make these threads stronger, one must read — read and ponder. This article is an attempt to think through one of the
                ways you can model the world and your significance in it, and further take these life-defining choices.

            <h2>The <i>Burden</i> of Human Birth</h2>
            <blockquote>
                <p>"रात गँवाई सोय कर, दिवस गवायों खाय। <br>
                    हीरा जनम अनमोल था, कौड़ी बदले जाये॥" <br>
                    (The night is lost in sleep, the day is lost in eating. <br>
                    This diamond-like birth is priceless, that you're trading for cowrie shells.)
                </p>
                <footer>Saint Kabir</footer>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                In Hindu mythology, the human birth is considered a rare culmination, a form attained only after passing through 84,000 other yonis (species). This rarity imparts a
                impetus to make the most of this life. Swami Vivekananda encapsulated the purpose of life in the dictum: ātmano mokṣārthaṃ, jagaddhitāya ca (for the emancipation of
                one's self and the good of the universe.)<sup><a href="#ref1"><u>1</u></a></sup></p>
            <p>
                This is a tall order - a heavy burden placed upon one at birth. And being born into a sufficiently privileged background, having the comfort of thinking about <i>jagaddhit</i>
                without having to think of the bread of the day presses more into this responsibility. This is a slippery slope. This sense of burden is often leads to a transactional
                view of life: a belief that because we have received much from the world - genetics, nurture, education - hence we are in its debt and further a burden to repay the debt.
                This transforms the <i>grand project of life</i> into a dreary accounting exercise, extinguishing the very spark it purports to serve by demanding we labour to repay a debt.
                While it is true that we inherit much from the world, it is equally true that this same world delivers us into a condition of ceaseless striving. To borrow Schopenhauer’s phrase,
                it endows us the “will,” the restless impulse that ensures that no attainment fully satisfies, that <u>every satisfaction is only the prelude to new want</u>. Along with nurture and
                comfort, society also implants its anxieties, its hierarchies of success, its specter of failure. What has been bestowed is inseparable from what has been imposed<sup><a href="#ref2"><u>1</u></a></sup>. This is the
                foundation of the above dictum. The world gives us much, but also gives us the foundational will to strive - the fundamental reason of suffering. This makes a man, whose heart can
                see the <i>pain imposed by the society on the society, to empathise with the society.</i></p>
            <p>
                The dictum itself offers an explanation for this. It clarifies that these two goals are not in conflict, but are like a root and its flower. The welfare of the world (jagaddhit)
                is the bloom that can only emerge from the root of one's own liberation (ātmano mokṣārthaṃ). To force a contribution to the world without first attending to one's own inner clarity
                is to demand a flower from a severed stem. For you cannot give what you do not possess: a mind clouded by obligation cannot bring clarity; a spirit shackled by duty cannot inspire freedom.
                To present it in a Randian way,
            <blockquote>
                <p>
                    By the grace of reality and the nature of life, man — every man — is an end in himself, he exists for his own sake, and the achievement of his own happiness
                    is his highest moral purpose. But neither life nor happiness can be achieved by the pursuit of irrational whims. Just as man is free to attempt to survive in any random manner,
                    but will perish unless he lives as his nature requires, so he is free to seek his happiness in any mindless fraud, but the torture of frustration is all he will find, unless he
                    seeks the happiness proper to man.
                </p>
                <footer>Ayn Rand</footer>
            </blockquote>

            </p>
            <p>
                The modern man's modern life - the one that he lives in his 4BHK apartment, with a car, a stable job, a family, and a comfortable retirement plan - is often a far cry from the "happiness proper to man".
                Its a life burdened by the weight of biological instincts and not the lightness of a conscious choice. Once you are the point where you have this, you stand like the Wanderer that stood above
                the Sea of Fog. <img src="assets/blog_4/Caspar_David_Friedrich_-_Wanderer_above_the_Sea_of_Fog.jpeg" alt="Wanderer above the Sea of Fog by Caspar David Friedrich" style="max-width: 80%; height: auto; display: block; margin: 20px auto;">
                You contemplate of all the heroes that you read about - Howard Roark, John Galt, Napolean Bonaparte, Julius Caesar - and you question whether this is what you want to do - to calculate the
                Profit and Loss for a HNI sitting in USA. You give a dreaded look to all your ideals and you wonder whether you are living a life of your own, or are you just a cog in the machine of the society,
                a pawn in the game of the biological instincts.

            <h2>The Two Flames: Melancholy or Sacrifice </h2>
            <p>
                These choices aren't career choices, rather they are two different existential stances. Agyeya writes in his poem,
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                 <p>
                    अपने जीवन का रस देकर जिसको यत्नों से पाला है,<br>
                    क्या वह केवल अवसाद-मलिन झरते आँसू की माला है?
                 </p>
                 <footer>अज्ञेय</footer>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                He asks whether this life, the one that you envisioned from childhood to be embodiment of Prometheus and Faust, is just a garland of tears that fall in melancholy. This melancholy is not a
                dramatic despair, but a constant, biting, menacing sadness that irritates without necessarily provoking revolt. It is the feeling of self-degradation that comes from the sense of pettiness
                - the feeling that you are insignificant in working towards the goal of either ātmano mokṣārth or jagaddhit, in spite it being the biting, immediate and logical need.
            </p>
            <p>
                But what's the alt-side? The alt-side is modeling your life's work as an impersonal sacrifice - not to any higher ideal or cause - but just to living the life fully.
                This is a sacrifice unto yourself - to rebel against the melancholic realities of the biological instincts that drive the modern comfortable life. Agyeya in the same poem write this as,
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>
                    मैंने विदग्ध हो जान लिया, अन्तिम रहस्य पहचान लिया,<br>
                    मैंने आहुति बन कर देखा यह प्रेम यज्ञ की ज्वाला है!
                </p>
                <footer>अज्ञेय</footer>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                One's life's works are a sacrifice unto the यज्ञ (the sacrificial fire) of life itself. The work is guided by the dictum, and yet isn't some grand project done in the name of <i>legacy</i>.
                The person aiming to do such a work aims to change lives of people (by various degrees) by his contributions - and aims that these contributions live beyond him. But he doesn't envisage it as a
                personal contribution, rather as a contribution of the human spirit to the human spirit. This is what Vedantic rishis meant when they asked the jeev to move towards the <i>atman</i> and
                not towards the <i>aham</i>.

            <h2>A Model for Contribution: The Parable of the Train</h2>
            <p>
                The world as we see is a load of sensory input that we have evolutionarily adapted to model in a certain way - we see RGB as a world where abstract concepts like objects, relations exist while
                fundamentally what we are seeing is just a bunch of waves - auditory, visual, tactile etc. This model is a useful one, but we need to have a better model of the world in the light of the advancements
                of human civilisation, where abundance has rendered the sole pursuit of survival unimportant. We need a model which:
                <ol>
                    <li>Models the actions taking in the world and their results accurately and abstractly,</li>
                    <li>Is able to supply a downstream utility function for the person that in turn 'satisfies' the person.</li>
                </ol>
                In light of these things, with whatever life I have lived and understood from others, following is an <i>attempt to artciulate my attempt to model the world</i>:<br>

                <h4>
                    What is progress?
                </h4>

                The world is a train moving in the direction of progress of human civilisation and conscioussness. The rise of science has lead to one of the most profound changes in the way someone interacts with the world.
                The unknown mystic forces that were thought to be causes for natural phenomena have been replaced by the scientific method, which has allowed us to understand the world in a more accurate and abstract way. Apart from this
                the philosophical advancements starting from the very old Upanishadic age and Greek Philosophers to the much more complex classical easter philosophical systems and the modern European philosophers have made it much better for
                me a 21st century inhabitant to model the undertainities and the apathy of the universe - physical and spiritual.
                
                <h4>
                    Who is driving the train?
                </h4>
                This is the broad dircetion of progress that the train is moving in, and there are different people playing myriad of roles in this:
                <ol>
                    <li>The Engines of Creation (The Prime Movers): These are the forces that generate forward momentum.
                        <ol>
                            <li>The Foremost Engine: Fundamental Truth. This is the work of pure mathematics and deep philosophy. It doesn't just power the train; it lays down the very abstract principles upon which the tracks are built. Its contribution is the most profound but also the most removed from immediate application. These are the people who are nearest to "trying to understand the nature of reality".</li>
                            <li>The Second Engine: Fundamental Science. Physics, biology, etc. It takes the abstract language of the first engine and uses it to understand the material world, turning principles into knowledge.</li>
                            <li>The Third Engine: Applied Science & Engineering Research. This takes the abstractions from the level above and tries to explain the things unexplained from above using empirical observations from the world rather than theoretical reasoning.</li>
                            <li>The Fourth Engine: Engineering & Technology. This engine turns knowledge into tangible tools and technologies. This is the engineering and development work that takes the things known from the above 3 and makes tangible things that directly affect the world.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                </ol>

                As we go down the heirarchy of engines, the contribution while more apparent is lesser widely applicable and less penetrating into the arrow of time. Very interestingly the famous mathematician G. H. Hardy
                wrote:
                <blockquote>
                    <p>
                        I have never done anything “useful.” No discovery of mine has made, or is likely to make, directly or indirectly, for good or ill, the least difference to the
                        amenity of the world. ...I have just one chance of escaping a verdict of complete triviality, that I may be judged to have created something worth creating.

                    </p>
                <footer>G. H. Hardy in A Mathematician’s Apology</footer>
                </blockquote>

                Hardy, in his intellectual honesty, saw only abstract beauty and could not foresee the staggering utility of his work. Yet the reality now has a much different verdict.
                This "useless" mathematics became foundational to the modern world. It is no exaggeration to say that the very digital signals carrying these words to you, the cryptographic
                methods securing our online lives, and the medical imaging techniques that see inside the human body all rely on the abstract patterns he discovered. And its difficult to emphaise how wide ranging are
                the effects of his work. This is an embodiment of the fact that the works of the foremost engine don't have direct apparent applications, but are much more pervasive in long run applications.</p></p>

                Now going beyong the first rung of the train come the stewards of the train, who while not propelling the train, are enablers of the progress.

                <ol>
                    <li>The Cars of Maintenance & Facilitation (The System's Lubricant): They reduce friction and distribute resources.
                        <ol>
                            <li>The Fuel & Lubricant Cars: Finance, law, management, logistics. Their role is to ensure the fuel (capital, resources, human effort) is efficiently allocated and the system runs smoothly.</li>
                            <li>The Passenger Cars: The vast majority of people who live their lives, contribute to the economy, and keep the social fabric of the train intact.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                </ol>

                While these are absolutely necessary for the train to progress, they in no way are direct contributors to the progress. They are enablers, facilitators, and maintainers of the system.
                This is the place that most people find them and this is generally the most handsomly paid category also. The incentive structure of capitalism is built on the same incentives that the biological
                systems give - survival. <br>

                The last rung of the train is the one that is actively working against the progress of the train. They are the ones who are trying to slow down, derail it, and destroy the train. They are the forces of entropy and destruction.
                The include activities like Crime, war, willful ignorance, corruption and its out of scope to discuss upon them in this article.

                This is the model of what the world systems that humans have built till now, but there's a different world model that is more inherent to the nature of the world. The model that humans see not only now,
                but saw even ten thousand years ago. This is best approached from the (partial) lens of Thomas Liggoti. He says:
                
                <blockquote>
                    <p>
                        Undeniably, one of the greatest disadvantages of consciousness, that is, consciousness considered as the parent of all horrors, is that it exacerbates necessary sufferings and
                        creates unnecessary ones, such as the fear of death. Not having what it takes to take their own lives (ask Gloria Beatty), those who suffer intolerably learn to hide their afflictions,
                        both necessary and unnecessary, because the world does not run on pain time but on happy time, whether or not that happiness is honestly felt or a mask for the blackest despondency.
                    </p>
                    <footer>Thomas Liggoti</footer>
                </blockquote>
                The human consciousness is a mis-step in evolution, something where nature outdid itself in creating.<sup><a href="http://x.com/feludamitter/status/1878179193982476446"><u>1</u></a></sup> The world is apathetic
                and inconsiderate to the conscious yearnings of man. Hence under pretext of this completely meaningless world, the logical step is to find an objective anchor. With passage of life it becomes readily
                apparent that this anchor is the suffering created as by product of this yearning. This suffering is both ubiqutous and real (in the sense that you can't fake or escape it). Then it becomes  a logical next step
                to think that working to the best possible of one's abilities to reduce this suffering, or in other words contribute to the meaningful furthering of the progress of the train should be the
                underlying aim of one's life. This clearly ties to the previous point about creation that I have made. <sub><a href="https://soham-kumar.github.io/blogs/blog_1.html"><u>1</u></a></sub><br>


                So tying these two views it becomes apparent that the best way to live is to be at the best possible forefront of the train given the current circumstances.

                    This conflict ended when I charged out the front door of our family home. Lingering outside were some friends of mine who took note of my fury and asked me what was up
                    The first words I spoke were derogatory of my parents.<br><br>

                    “You shouldn’t say that,” admonished one of my friends. I could see that the others agreed.<br>
                    “Why not?” I responded in a defiant tone. And then the answer.<br>
                    “Because if it weren’t for your mom and dad you wouldn’t be alive.”<br><br>

                    I pondered the summary logic of this rebuke to the harsh words I had spoken about my parents ... Was I supposed to credit my progenitors with bringing me to life,
                    as if I were Frankenstein’s monster, a thing of inanimate parts into which they had breathed vitality? Had I been only a configuration of dead matter in another
                    dimension prior to the success of their efforts to usher me into the realm of the living? ... In its flight from cognitive dissonance, my childhood brain could
                    not accept that I was just as dead before I lived as I would be when I ceased to breathe. It seemed ludicrous to me that death was a sort of vise that closed in
                    on my life from both ends. All the same, I could not wholly dismiss the supposition.<br>

                    If not among the dead, then where had I existed before my parents rescued me? It must have been someplace very bad in my buddies’ minds to provoke their chastisement
                    of me for denigrating my begetters. Fortunately, my contemplation of the whole issue was quickly put aside so that I could play with my friends.”<br>
