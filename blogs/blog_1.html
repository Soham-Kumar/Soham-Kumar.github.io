            <h3>भूमिका</h3>
            <p>
                Venturing into life, especially at the stage where one becomes both capable and compelled to make decisions, presents two paths: the well defined
                path usually shaped by societal norms or to approach life with first principles. . While first-principle thinking may clash with practical realities
                and a lot of your future is tainted by past decisions, to be truly conscious is to define your life's foundational axioms and let your actions stem
                from them, rather than being dictated by the weight of what has been. <sup><a href="#ref1">1</a></sup> <sup><a href="#ref2">2</a></sup>

        <!-- Paragraph 1 -->
        <section id="para-1">
            <h3>Man is condemned to be free</h3>
            <p>
                <blockquote>
                    "Man is condemned to be free. Condemned, because he did not create himself; in other respect is free because, once thrown into the world, he is responsible for everything he does." 
                    <footer>~  Jean-Paul Sartre, Existentialism and Human Emotions</footer>
                </blockquote>

                <i>"Condemned to be free"</i> may sound paradoxical, but it encapsulates the human condition: compelled to act yet burdened with justifying those actions.
                Humanity stands between animals and gods—neither bound by pure instinct nor entirely free of it. This freedom demands reflection and this is what defines the
                human life - the need to find a <i>raison d'être</i> to navigate the sufferings of daily existence.<sup><a href="#ref3">3</a></sup></br></br>

                The biology, the nature doesn't owe you a beautiful existence, it doesn't owe you a life that you will like - its optimized to perpetuate itself, and not for the
                satisfaction of the individuals that constitute it. But it does realize that a one needs some trinkets to be pleasured with to keep the machinery running. You are lucky
                if these trinkets take you far in life, but there must come a time sooner or later that these trinkets start looking as what they truly are - childish playthings. Upon
                hitting this realization, good and bad both times start having an undercurrent of deep, unwavering and surreal feeling of meaninglessness. The second consequence (or the
                second order effect) of this realization is the loss of <i>home</i>. Frued talks about the loss of a loved object through disappointment and how it leads to losing a part
                of yourself and its relation to melancholy.<sup><a href="#ref4">4</a></sup> This loss of meaning is imminent to come to everyone, but to some death comes first. Who is luckier:
                one who lives merrily, deceived by fleeting illusions, or the one burdened by the weight of their falsity?</br></br>

                But why doesn't life have an inherent meaning? Because asking for the meaning of life is asking for a linear answer to a circular question.</br>

            </p>
                <!-- Dialogue Block -->
                <div class="dialogue-block">
                    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Person A:</span> Why do you exist?</p>
                    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Person B:</span> ...well, I exist because my parents reproduced.</p>
                    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Person A:</span> That doesn't explain why your parents exist. I could just keep asking why to all of your responses all the way back to the Big Bang,
                        at which point you'll essentially be saying because existence began to which I will ask why did existence begin, and we will have arrived back at square one. So, I'll ask again why,
                        why are you?"</p>
                    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Person B:</span> Uhmmm I exist to bring my future children into this world.</p>
                    <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Person A:</span> We have the same issue again just in the opposite direction. I can keep asking why until we get to the inevitable heat death of the universe
                        and you'll run out of answers. That's exactly the issue though. That's why I'm saying - there's no meaning to any of it. It's all for nothing. Looking backwards it's accidents all the way back and
                        there's no meaning to any of it looking forwards, it all comes to an end. So that settles it then - that's your answer - that it's all for nothing. Both the ends of the thread
                        of time are loose and all you have to do is pull, and the whole damn thing unravels back to the present moment. There's no real point in getting out of bed in the morning,
                        no point in having kids, my parents gave birth to me for no reason at all, and it's all for nothing.</br></br>
                        What's it <i>ALL</i> for? It can't all be for something else because then you wouldn't have been talking about IT ALL, would you? Your question cannot be answered without referring to
                        something within your expression IT ALL. For even if I did give you an answer that referred to something outside of IT ALL, like heaven for instance, as soon as its existence was an
                        established fact it would be contained within the expression IT ALL.</p>

            Clearly life can not have any meaning beyond itself. The meaning of life is that it <b>is</b>.

                <blockquote>
                    “You'll have a good, secure life when being alive means more to you than security, love more than money, your freedom more than public or partisan opinion, when the mood of Beethoven's or
                    Bach's music becomes the mood of your whole life … when your thinking is in harmony, and no longer in conflict, with your feelings … when you let yourself be guided by the thoughts of great
                    sages and no longer by the crimes of great warriors … when you pay the men and women who teach your children better than the politicians; when truths inspire you and empty formulas repel you;
                    when you communicate with your fellow workers in foreign countries directly, and no longer through diplomats…”

            <h3>My Take</h3>
            <p>
                I’m particularly impressed by the seamless integration of visual and sequence-based learning. 
                However, there are challenges, such as scaling to diverse environments and ensuring generalization across tasks.
