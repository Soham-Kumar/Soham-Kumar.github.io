            <p>
                Venturing into life, especially at the stage where one becomes both capable and compelled to make decisions, presents two paths: the well-defined path usually shaped by societal norms, or the path of approaching life with first principles. While first-principle thinking may clash with practical realities, and much of our future is influenced by past decisions, to be truly conscious is to strive to define one's life's foundational axioms and let actions stem from them, rather than being solely dictated by the weight of what has been. <sup><a href="#ref1">1</a></sup> <sup><a href="#ref2">2</a></sup>

            <h2>Man is condemned to be free</h2>
            <blockquote>
                <p>"Man is condemned to be free. Condemned, because he did not create himself; yet in other respects is free because, once thrown into the world, he is responsible for everything he does."</p>
                <footer>Jean-Paul Sartre, Existentialism and Human Emotions</footer>
            </blockquote>

            <p>
                <i>"Condemned to be free"</i> may sound paradoxical, but it encapsulates the human condition: compelled to choose and act, yet burdened with the responsibility of justifying those actions. Humanity exists in a space between animals driven purely by instinct and hypothetical gods free from such constraints. This inherent freedom demands reflection; it necessitates finding a <i>raison d'être</i> to navigate the inherent sufferings and challenges of daily existence.<sup><a href="#ref3">3</a></sup>
            </p>
            <p>
                Nature, or biology, is optimized for self-perpetuation, not necessarily for individual satisfaction. It provides "trinkets" – fleeting pleasures and drives – to keep the biological machinery running. One might feel fortunate if these suffice for a time, but often a point arrives where these motivations feel hollow, like childish playthings. This realization can lead to an undercurrent of meaninglessness, even during good times. Freud discussed how the loss of a loved object (or ideal) through disappointment can lead to melancholy and a feeling of losing part of oneself.<sup><a href="#ref4">4</a></sup> This existential questioning seems almost inevitable for a reflective mind, though perhaps death intervenes for some before it fully surfaces. Who is luckier: the one living merrily, potentially deceived by illusions, or the one burdened by awareness of their potential falsity?
            </p>
            <p>
                But why does life lack an inherent, externally provided meaning? Perhaps because asking for "the meaning of life" is like asking for a linear answer to a fundamentally circular or self-referential question.

                <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Person A:</span> That doesn't explain why your parents exist. I could keep asking 'why' back to the Big Bang. Then you'd say 'because existence began,' and I'd ask 'why did existence begin?' We're back where we started. So, why <i>you</i>?</p>
                <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Person B:</span> Uhm... I exist to bring future children into the world?</p>
                <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Person A:</span> Same problem, different direction. I can ask 'why' until the heat death of the universe. You run out of answers. That's the issue. There's no ultimate external 'why'. Looking backward, it's contingency; looking forward, it ends. Does that mean it's all for nothing? That there's no point?</p>
                <p><span class="dialogue-speaker">Person A:</span> What's it <i>ALL</i> for? If the answer refers to something else (like 'heaven'), that 'something else' immediately becomes part of the 'ALL' we're asking about. The question loops back onto itself.</p>

            <p>
                If life cannot derive meaning from something entirely outside itself, perhaps the meaning is intrinsic: the meaning of life <em>is</em> that it is, that it exists and experiences.

            <blockquote>
                <p>“You'll have a good, secure life when being alive means more to you than security, love more than money, your freedom more than public or partisan opinion, when the mood of Beethoven's or Bach's music becomes the mood of your whole life … when your thinking is in harmony, and no longer in conflict, with your feelings … when you let yourself be guided by the thoughts of great sages and no longer by the crimes of great warriors … when you pay the men and women who teach your children better than the politicians; when truths inspire you and empty formulas repel you; when you communicate with your fellow workers in foreign countries directly, and no longer through diplomats…”</p>
                <footer>Wilhelm Reich, Listen, Little Man!</footer>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Reich suggests a life oriented towards intrinsic values—authenticity, connection, beauty, truth, freedom—rather than purely external metrics like security or opinion.</p>
